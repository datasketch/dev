      <description>At Datasketch, we want to make data science more accessible and more inclusive, and we believe that one of the big challenges in bringing the data to the people is about translating the language in which the information is presented.
For more accessibility and inclusion, we need easy ways to create data visualization and analysis tools so that non-coders and non-statisticians can understand data; and the ability to internationalize this information: to translate these tools into multiple languages and communicate the information to people all across the world.</description>

      <description>We are building data visualization and analysis Shiny Apps that are (hopefully) very easy to use for non-tech users.
We embarked on a quest to make data science more accessible for non-coders. In 2019 2e launched a successful kickstarter campaign to democratize data visualization for people with non-programming experience. Nos after some months of development we are seeing live the first versions of our self-services data visualization and analysis tools.</description>
